For those people who have a Fitbit, you've probably been wondering how exactly Fitbit comes up with your sleep score. Sometimes you sleep for shorter periods of time with similar amounts of REM and deep sleep but still get a better sleep score. Other times you have rather low amounts of REM and deep sleep but a better score than a night of higher amounts of those. What's the secret behind this?\n","That's precisely what I will answer throughout this
